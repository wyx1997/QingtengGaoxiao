# Qingteng-Project

This project was completed by a group made up of some college students, which called Qingteng-Group. Our team spent one month completing it, and just one day after the ending of national examination for college, we published V1.0.0. It cost us much time to spread our App and we wanted to help as many students as possible to escape the holes we had fallen into serveral years ago.

I am in charge of design of UI and the implemention of whole app. Although the UI may not be nice and the implemention of some functions may also has problems in performance and code style, I have to say that I am proud of this project as my first experience of completing whole app. And also I gained a lot from that period.
